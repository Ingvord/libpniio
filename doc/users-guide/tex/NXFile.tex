{\tt NXFile} is the root for all data structures. 
Fortunately this class is also the simplest among the three {\tt NX} classes.
{\tt NXFile} is a descandent of {\tt NXGroup}, thus it exposes the full 
interface of {\tt NXGroup}. Since this will be the treated in the next 
section we will consider here only the file specific methods. 

For this purpose let's have a look on a simple example that already shows
everything we need to know in order to handle files. 
\lstinputlisting{../examples/c++/nxfile_ex1.cpp}
Lines 11-14 show the basic code sequence to create a new file. Setting 
overwrite to true (line 12) discardes an already existing file with the
same name. By default this option is not set in order to prevent a user 
from accidentaly overwritting existing files.
Once a file is opened or created any subsequent call to {\tt create()}, {\tt
setReadOnly} {\tt setOverwrite()}, or {\tt open()} will raise an  {\tt
NXFileError} exception.
The reason is that you must not change these attributes of the class 
while a file is open. First close the file object by invoking the 
{\tt close()} method. 

Once a file is created you may want to invoke its current status. 
This is shown in the next listing.
\lstinputlisting{../examples/c++/nxfile_ex2.cpp}
The interesting part of the code is shown in lines 16, 19, and 22.
The meaning of the methods shown in this lines is self explaining. 
All return bool values and are thus suitable for being used in 
conditional statements.
