%%%NXField documentation

In the Nexus world the payload (your real data) is stored in fields which 
are represented in this library by objects of class {\tt NXField}.
Like groups, fields cannot be instantiated by their constructor but are 
rather created using factory methods provided by all classes derived 
from  {\tt NXGroup}. One word of caution: a prerequisit for understanding 
this section is a fundamental knowledge of the data objects provided 
by {\tt libpniutils}. If you are not please consult the {\tt libpniutils}
users guide first.
One can distinguish between two basic types of fields: string-fields
and numeric-fields. The former hold string data while the later 
holds numbers.   

\subsection{Creating fields}

The first step to use fields is to create them. Field creation for 
string and numeric fields is shown in this next example.
