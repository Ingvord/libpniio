%%low level objects in the library

The API is quite minimalistic. From a users point of view only 
three classes are required: {\tt NXFile}, {\tt NXGroup}, and {\tt NXField}.
This are the basic components required to create a valid Nexus file and 
fill it with data. Each of this classes will be presented in a separate 
section of this chapter. 
Because using links takes a little more explanation this topic has 
its own section in at the very end of this chapter.
