/*! \page usage Using libpninx @VERSION@

This page describes how to use the library along with your code. 

\section usage_sec1 Using libpninx the hard way
As you may have recognized in the installation manual \c libpninx links
against a whole bunch of libraries. This means that you have to add this
libraries to your linker flags in order to link against the library. 
Let us assume that we have a program in a file name \c main.cpp which we want
to link against \c libpninx. If we would do everything manually the compiler
command would look like this

As \c libpninx uses a lot of C++11 features it is absolutely important that
you do not forget to add the \b -std=c++0x flag to the compiler call.
One possible compiler call would look like this

\code
$> g++ -std=c++0x -o program main.cpp -llibpniutils -lboost_regex -lhdf5
\endcode
This is obviously not very comfortable. In particular things are much worser:
The number of linker flags varies with the options used to compile \c
libpniutils. The better solution is thus to use \c pkg-config. 

\section usage_sec2 Using libpninx with pkg-config

The \c libpninx provides a \c pninx.pc configuration file for
\c pkg-config. This file is usually installed under the same directory as the
libraries binaries in a subdirectory called \c pkgconfig. On an Ubuntu system
this would be for instance \c /usr/lib/pkgconfig/pninx.pc. 
Since this directory is usually in the search path of \c pkg-config no
additional work most be done and the above compiler command reduces to 
\code
$> g++ -std=c++0x -o program main.cpp $(pkg-config --libs --cflags pninx)
\endcode
If you have installed the libraries in some other directory, lets say under \c
/opt/pninx/lib you have to set the \c PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the appropriate
directory in advance of the previous compiler call. In this example here you
have to use
\code
$> export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/pninx/lib/pkgconfig
\endcode
to tell \c pkg-config where to look for the configuration file for \c libpninx.
\c pkg-config can also be use from within a Makefile as shown in this example
(the Makefile for the examples provided with the source distribution)
\includelineno Makefile
In lines 2 and 3 \c pkg-config is used to obtain all the flags required to build
code using \c libpninx. Dependencies of \c libpniutils are managed automatically
as this library provides a \c pkg-config file too.
