``libpniio`` is a library from the PNI C++ stack providing IO functionality.
Although its primary concern is to read and write data stored in Nexus files,
additional functionalities are provided which may ease the transition from
custom binary or ASCII formats to Nexus.
This manual is intended for developers who want to use ``libpniio``. Thus, it
assumes that the library itself along with its development files is already
installed on your system. 

Add a new paragraph just to see if cmake recompiles the documentation.
