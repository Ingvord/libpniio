Nexus files can be considered as a heterogeneous container (a container holding
instances of different types). This section describes algorithms that work on 
particular Nexus objects.

These classes are used internally by the algorithm functions and are thus not of
great interest to the common library user. However, they might be interesting
for library developers.
