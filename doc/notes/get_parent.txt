Retrieving the parent object 
============================

In HDF5 like in any Unix file system objects themselfes are associated with a
path. Consequently, in HDF5, several paths can identify the same object. 
When a user, however, wants to retrieve the parent of a particular oject he
usually wants the parent as determined by the current path associated with the
object. 
Thus we have to deal with internal HDF5 paths rather than doing this on a more
abstract level.
