\defgroup variant_code Nexus and BOOST::variant 

Nexus files can be considered as a heterogeneous container (a container holding
instances of different types). This is obviously a problem for a strongly typed
language like C++. Luckily BOOST::variant provides an easy way how to deal with
this issues. 
The types and functions of this module make this feature available.
