Installation instructions
=========================

1.) Prerequisits
    ------------

Required software to build libpninx:
-> gcc >= 4.4.1
-> cmake >= 2.6.0

To build the documentation some additional programs are required
-> doxygen
-> pdflatex
-> pygmented

Library dependencies:
-> libpnicore >= 0.9.4
-> boost      >= 1.46
-> HDF5       >= 1.5.8
-> cppunit 

As libpniio relies on several C++11 features a rather recent compiler is
required. Thus gcc >= 4.4 is required to build the code. 

2.) Build and installation
    ----------------------

libpniio uses CMAKE for building. Thus, out of place builds (in a separate
directory) are recommended. After downloading and unpacking the source tree 
create a new directory (not within the source tree) somewhere on your file
system and change into it 

$> mkdir libpniio-build
$> cd libpniio-build

From this directory call cmake with 

$> cmake /path/to/source/dir

CMAKE is doing all the configuration work for you like finding libraries and
header files and setting the include and linker paths correctly. If you
installation does not differ too much from the Linux File System standard no
special actions from you are required instead setting the installation prefix.
By default the software is installed to /usr which requires you to have root
permissions at least for the installation step. 
In order to change the installation prefix you can set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
variable when calling cmake with

$> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/prefix /path/to/sources

Once cmake has finished its run the installation is straight forwared

$> make 
$> make install
