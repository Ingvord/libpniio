Installation instructions
=========================

1.) Prerequisits
    ------------

Required software to build libpninx:
-> scons 
-> doxygen
-> latex

Library dependencies:
-> libpniutils
-> boost
-> HDF5

libpninx relies on C++11 standard so you need a compliant compiler. 
The code is developed with gcc-4.6. Backports will be provided in future 
to make builds possible for gcc-4.4 and gcc-4.5.


2.) Build and installation
    ----------------------

2.1.) Building and installation under Linux
      -------------------------------------
          
If everything is installed under standard locations you only need to run 
scons in the root directory of the source directory.

$> scons

In cases where your libraries are installed under non-standard locations 
additional parameters can be used. For instance

$> scons BOOSTPREFIX=/usr/local/boost HDF5PREFIX=/usr/local/hdf5

must be used in cases where boost and hdf5 are installed under 
/usr/local/boost and /usr/local/hdf5 respectively. 
In some cases you may want to use a different compiler. This can be done 
using the CXX variable

$> scons CXX=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.6

To install the library use 

$> scons install

where the software will be installed under standard location /usr. 
To change the installation prefix use

$> scons PREFIX=/opt/pninx install

It might be interesting to build only the documentation in order to 
get familiar with libpninx before starting the installation. In this case 
simply run

$> scons doc

Documentation will reside under ./doc in the root directory of the source 
distribution. For further information about installation and build 
process see the administrators guide which can be found in ./doc/admin-guide.


2.2.) Build and installation on Windows
