Installation instructions
=========================

1.) Prerequisits
    ------------

Required software to build libpninx:
-> gcc >= 4.4.1
-> cmake >= 2.6.0

To build the documentation some additional programs are required
-> doxygen
-> pdflatex
-> pygmented

Library dependencies:
-> libpnicore >= 0.9.4
-> boost      >= 1.46
-> HDF5       >= 1.5.8
-> cppunit 

As libpniio relies on several C++11 features a rather recent compiler is
required. Thus gcc >= 4.4 is required to build the code. 

2.) Build and installation
    ----------------------

2.1.) Building on Linux
      -----------------

If everything is installed under standard locations you only need to run 
scons in the root directory of the source directory.

$> scons

If you want to use a different C++ compiler than the default system compiler use
the CXX build variable like this

$> scons CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-4.6

SCons tries to do some auto-configuration before the build. If it finds all the
required libraries by itself you are well off and the build will run. 
However, in situations where required libraries are installed in non-standard
locations, or in locations not known by the linker you have to use special build
variables to pass this information to scons.

If BOOST is not in a standard location you can use the BOOSTPREFIX build
variable

$> scons BOOSTPREFIX=/usr/local/boost 

which assumes that libraries and headers are installed und BOOSTPREFIX/lib and 
BOOSTPREFIX/include respectively. The prefix variables for HDF5 (HDF5PREFIX) and 
libpniutils (PNIUPREFIX) behave in the same manner. 

To build only the documentation (which resides under the doc directory 
in the source tree simply type

$> scons doc

To cleanup the source directory use 

$> scons -c


2.1.) Installation on Linux
      ---------------------

For the installation you have basically two possibilities: you can either
install the libraries directly from the source tree to your system, or, if you
use a Debian system (or any derived system like Ubuntu) you can build an
appropriate package for installation.

To install directly from the sources you simply type 

$> scons install

in the root directory of the code tree. In this case the scons tries to install
the software under the default prefix /usr. This implies that you need root
permissions to install.
To install libpninx under a different location use

$> scons PREFIX=/opt/pninx install
